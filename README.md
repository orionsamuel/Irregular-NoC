# Irregular-NoC
This project is about my dissertation for master title. In this project, a NoC (Network-on-Chip) with irregular topoly is created. Trough a genetic algorithm the maping is done to choose the better configuration irregular topology in latency and deadline terms. The NoC was developed in SystemC library.
